# Implementation Plan

## Project Setup
- Define project structure
- Set up version control and branching strategy
- Create initial repositories and file structures

## Architecture Decisions
- **Frameworks**: Determine the tech stack for frontend and backend
- **Hosting**: Choose cloud provider

## Database Schema
- Define entities (e.g., Users, Projects, Tasks)
- Establish relationships between entities
- Create initial schema design diagrams

## API Endpoints
- Document RESTful endpoints for each resource
- Define request/response formats
- Add authentication mechanisms to sensitive endpoints

## Frontend Components
- List out primary components needed (e.g., Dashboard, Task List)
- Define component structure and props/state management

## Authentication
- Choose authentication method (e.g., JWT, OAuth)
- Define user roles and permissions

## Real-time Collaboration
- Research solutions for real-time updates (e.g., WebSockets)
- Define how collaboration will work in UI

## Deployment Pipeline
- Define CI/CD tools and processes
- Set up deployment environments (staging, production)

## Next Steps
- Review this implementation plan
- Break down tasks into smaller issues for tracking
- Assign team members to specific tasks

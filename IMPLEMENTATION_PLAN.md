# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation details based on the initial plan and all decisions made. It serves as a guide for developers and stakeholders involved in the project.

## Overview
The implementation plan lays out the structure of the project, the technologies to be utilized, and the workflow to ensure successful completion.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js for building user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **Hosting**: Heroku for deploying the application.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Development Environment**  
   Ensure all developers have a consistent environment for building and testing the application.

2. **Design User Interface**  
   Create wireframes and mockups based on user feedback. 

3. **Develop Frontend**  
   Implement the user interface with React.js. Ensure responsiveness and accessibility. 

4. **Set Up Backend**  
   Create the RESTful API endpoints using Node.js and Express.js. 

5. **Database Integration**  
   Connect the application to MongoDB. Ensure data is properly structured and indexed.

6. **Testing**  
   Implement unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

7. **Deployment**  
   Deploy the application to Heroku once testing is complete. Monitor performance and feedback.

## Decisions Made
- The choice of React.js was influenced by its large community and availability of resources.
- Node.js was selected for its asynchronous capabilities, making it well-suited for handling multiple connections.

## Conclusion
This implementation plan will be continuously updated as the project progresses and additional decisions are made. Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure alignment with project goals.
